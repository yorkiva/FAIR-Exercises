This repository is intended to create a series of notebooks that illustrate the FAIR principles in the context of High Energy Physics Data and AI models. The FAIR acronym stands for **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, and **R**eusable- benchmarking a set of desired qualities that ensure transparent and objective scientific data management.

## List of Notebooks:

- **01-Intro2FAIR.ipynb**: Introduces the FAIR principles and a set metrics used to evaluate FAIRness of datasets
- **02-FAIRCheck-MNIST.ipynb**: Explores the MNIST dataset and its FAIRness using the metrics introduced in the previous notebook
