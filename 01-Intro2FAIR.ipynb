    "# Introducing FAIR Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "FAIR represents a set of principles to ensure transparent and executive management of scientific datasets and models that was set forward in the 2016 seminal article titled  <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618\">\"The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship.\"</a> With a view to create a concise, measurable, and widely agreed upon set of standards that scientific data should meet across a number of knowledge domains, this article mentions the following set of ideas to establish the desired qualities for data and models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Findable:** In informal terms, Findability implies that a dataset should have the necessary properties so that it can be easily, faithfully, and intelligibly located in a failsafe fashion by those who want to and and are authorised to obtain it\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accessible:** While finding a dataset is important, it is often just the beginning. One who is able to locate it, should also be able to access it. Accessibility doesn't solely mean that you can download it from a server and store it in your laptop or in the fancy machines at your lab. One needs to be able to understand the dataset's context, content, and format- described in a fashion that is relatable for the domain-specific (and in some cases, even domain-agnostic) users.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interoperable:** Users within a scientific knowledge domain often use a wide range of platforms, languages, and customized or universal frameworks to use datasets for a number of purposes. Any datset that is intended to be used by multiple user groups should have adequate details so that it can be used by anyone with a reasonable application in mind. Depending on context it can simply mean that the dataset comes will well explained metadata and is presented in a format that can be read by most popular platforms within the field. In other cases, it can require creating a specific containers with the necessary software dependencies preserved within or making a neural network based model transportable across frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reusable:** Data and models should be equipped with clear instructions on who can use it and to what extent. It should also be clearly mentioned the origin and evolution of the dataset or model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An important aspect of the FAIR principles is that they apply in both human and machine readable context. While machine readable data and human readable metadata are more relatable concepts, machine readable metadata might be a little obscure. Metadata is often understood as a comprehensive collection of information about data- _data_ about data. It broadly includes what the dataset represents, how it is generated, who is allowed to use it etc. For instance, a tabular array should have enough information about what each row and column represents. Machine readable metadata ensures that any application of this dataset is managed in a comprehensive and objective fashion, independent of any user-specific subjective interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Measure FAIRness\n",
    "\n",
    "While the FAIR principles as a set of guidelines are abstract and somewhat philosophical in nature, it is important to define a set of measurable traits for them. These traits should be general enough to have cross-disciplinary appeal, unambiguously interpretable, and FAIR themselves. A set of 14 such metrics have been identified in the article  <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018118\">\"A design framework and exemplar metrics for FAIRness.\"</a> Description of these metrics are copied from the <a href=\"https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/\">Go FAIR project</a> website below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Findable:** \n",
    "  The first step in (re)using data is to find them. Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. Machine-readable metadata are essential for automatic discovery of datasets and services, so this is an essential component of the FAIRification process.\n",
    "\n",
    " - F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier\n",
    "\n",
    " - F2. Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)\n",
    "\n",
    " - F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe\n",
    "\n",
    " - F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accessible:**\n",
    "  Once the user finds the required data, they need to know how they can be accessed, possibly including authentication and authorisation.\n",
    "\n",
    " - A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A1.1 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable\n",
    "\n",
    "   - A1.2 The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary\n",
    "\n",
    " - A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interoperable:**\n",
    "  The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    " - I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.\n",
    "\n",
    " - I2. (Meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles\n",
    "\n",
    " - I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reusable:**\n",
    "  The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.\n",
    "\n",
    " - R1. Meta(data) are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "   - R1.1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license\n",
    "\n",
    "   - R1.2. (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance\n",
    "\n",
    "   - R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards \n",
    "\n",
